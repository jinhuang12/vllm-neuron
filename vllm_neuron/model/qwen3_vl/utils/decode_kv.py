"""Shared decode-time KV helpers for Qwen3-VL GQA (bf16 + native-MXFP8).

GQA decode (kv_heads_per_rank > 1, e.g. TP=4 on the 8-KV-head 32B model) reaches
the fused decode mega-kernel only with a PER-HEAD 3D block table + a 4D KV cache;
a 2D ``[B, num_blocks]`` table routes GQA to the slow torch fallback (see
``_can_use_attention_block_kernel``). These two pure-torch, device-agnostic helpers
build that table and scatter the kernel's 4D per-head new-K/V tokens back into the
paged cache. They live here (a shared utils module, not either model file) so the
bf16 (``model_bf16``) and native-MX (``model_mxfp8``) decode paths and the CPU
three-way reference use one definition and cannot drift.

    GQA fused decode mega-kernel requires: ``[B, kv_heads, num_blocks]``.

    The kernel squeezes the 4D KV cache head-inner into a ``[num_blocks*kv_heads]``
    pool, so each ``(batch, head)`` entry must be the GLOBAL pool index
    ``base*kv_heads + h``; ``-1`` (inactive) is preserved unchanged. Single source
    of truth shared by ``Qwen3VLTextAttention.forward_decode`` (bf16),
    ``Qwen3VLTextAttentionMX.forward_decode`` and the CPU three-way reference, so
    the kernel's GQA global-index convention is encoded in exactly one place (they
    cannot drift and mask a shared bug).

    The fused decode kernel returns 4D per-head tensors ``K_new [d_head, B, kv_heads, S]``
    / ``V_new [B, kv_heads, S, d_head]``. (When kv_heads == 1 the kernel drops K's
    head axis to 3D ``[d_head, B, S]``; callers re-insert it before calling here, so
    this function always sees the uniform 4D contract — for kv_heads == 1 the head
    axis is a singleton.) Both are reordered to head-major ``[kv_heads, B*S, d_head]``
    so the ``(head, block, pos)`` index_put enumeration below lands each
    ``(batch, token, head)`` row at its paged slot.

    ``slot_mapping`` is ``[B*S]`` in B-major (batch, token) order; row ``i`` of the
    flattened new K/V is ``(head = i // (B*S), token = i % (B*S))`` and is written to
    ``cache[block_of(token), head, pos_of(token)]``. Extracted as a free function so
    the permute/scatter mapping is unit-testable with known values (no kernel/device).
